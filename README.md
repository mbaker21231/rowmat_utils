# rowmat_utils

Repository for the Stata package rowmat_utils, which allows parallel computation over "many small" matrices at the same time; things like inverses, determinants, etc. This repository contains the critical file rowmat_utils_mata.do, which builds all of the mata functions and the associated .mlib file.
